            <h2>What is Racism?</h2>
                        <p>Racism takes many forms and can happen in many places. It includes prejudice, discrimination or hatred directed at someone because of their colour, ethnicity or national origin</p>

              <p>  People often associate racism with acts of abuse or harassment. However, it doesn’t need to involve violent or intimidating behaviour. Take racial name-calling and jokes. Or consider
                situations when people may be excluded from groups or activities because of where they come from.
            </p>

            <p>Racism can be revealed through people’s actions as well as their attitudes. It can also be reflected in systems and institutions. But sometimes it may not be revealed at all. Not all racism is obvious. For example, 
                someone may look through a list of job applicants and decide not to interview people with certain surnames</p>

            <p>Racism is more than just words, beliefs and actions. It includes all the barriers that prevent people from enjoying dignity and equality because of their race.</p>

            <h2>What is Prejudice?</h2>
                        <p>Prejudice is an assumption or an opinion about someone simply based on that person's membership to a particular group. 
                            For example, people can be prejudiced against someone else of a different ethnicity, gender, or religion.</p>

              <p>  If someone is acting on their prejudices, they are pre-judging (hence the term ‘prejudice’) someone before they even get a chance to know them on a 
                  deeper level. This is an irrational attitude and mindset and one that does no good for anyone involved.
            </p>

            <p>For example, a person might have a lot of preconceived ideas about someone who is Christian, Muslim, or Jewish and will allow those judgements to affect 
                the way they view and treat those people. The same can be true for people who are Black, White, or Asian</p>
